<h1 align="center">Ray-Ban Meta - NoteBuddy</h1>

Imagine reading a book or document and your AI assistant has the ability to summarize, save, and quiz you on what you read. Well RayBan Meta Notebuddy does just that. Notebuddy is a powerful iOS application that pairs with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses (via [Meta Wearables SDK](https://github.com/facebook/meta-wearables-dat-ios)) to transform physical documents into AI-summarized study cards. Scan documents hands-free through your smart glasses — or use your phone's camera as a fallback — extract text with OCR, generate intelligent summaries, and organize content into study decks with quiz mode.

Supports dual AI providers: [Apple Foundation Models](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/FoundationModels) for fully on-device, offline summarization, and OpenAI for cloud-powered summarization, text-to-speech, and quiz generation.

## Troubleshooting

### Glasses Won't Connect
1. Ensure glasses are powered on and in range
2. Check Bluetooth is enabled on iPhone
3. Try "Disconnect Glasses" then "Connect Glasses"
4. Restart the Meta AI app if installed

### Poor OCR Results
1. Enable Distance Mode in Settings
2. Ensure adequate lighting
3. Hold document steady until green indicator appears
4. Try moving slightly closer to the document
5. Try using the phone camera if glasses produce low-quality frames

### AI Summarization Not Working
- **Apple Intelligence**: Requires iOS 26+ and Apple Intelligence enabled in Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri
- **OpenAI**: Requires valid API key entered in Settings
- The app falls back to basic text extraction on unsupported configurations

### No Audio Through Glasses
1. Verify glasses are connected via Bluetooth A2DP
2. Check iPhone audio output is set to glasses
3. Ensure "Speak Summaries" is enabled in Settings
4. Audio automatically routes to phone speakers when glasses disconnect
